To run this project use:
npm install in main catalog (word-game)
npm start in main catalog (word-game)

npm install in server catalog (word-game/server)
node index.js in server catalog (word-game/server)

For the purposes of this to work on my device I had to turn cors in my Chrome web browser.

In case this is not working, just uncomment the code in GameScreen.tsx (line 4, 20 and 21) and comment the fetch function.
